This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

We are creating a static web application that will eventually be user-facing and in a production
environment. This is a greenfield project, no code currently exists so feel free to make an
educated decision on which language/framework/libraries to use.

A user authentication service has recently been developed
(https://github.com/dantame/interview-authentication-service) and this project will be the first to
integrate with it.

The user stories we have identified so far are:
1. As a user, I would like to be able to log in to the web application
2. As a user, I would like to view a personalised greeting when I log in so that I know Iâ€™m
logged in
3. As a user, I would like to be able to log out of the application
Rules

There are no rules to how you write your code and no trick questions! Treat this like you
would treat building any production-ready application from scratch. You may use any
programming language, libraries or framework you wish.

Please submit your project (either as a public repository or zip file) including instructions on
how to run it. If submitting as a zip, please include your .git directory (or equivalent) so that we
can see the commit history.
